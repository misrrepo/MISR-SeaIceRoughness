These are the steps to create the final mosaic.tif from roughness.dat files:

1- move_roughness_misr_files_from_POB2day.ipynb => to create subfolders for each day and move roughness files to each subfolder

2- roughness_array2raster_georefrencing.py

3- raster2mosaic.py

4- plot the final mosaic.tif later


also:

1- plot_ATM_paths.ipynb >>> plot ATM samples on map & extract ATM transect

2- transect_statistical_tests.ipynb >>> checks transect data and plots timeseries and performs statistics
