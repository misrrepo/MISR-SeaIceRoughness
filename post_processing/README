These are the steps to create the final mosaic.tif from roughness.dat files:

1- move_roughness_misr_files_from_POB2day.ipynb => to create subfolders for each day and move roughness files to each subfolder

2- roughness_array2raster_georefrencing.py

3- mosaic_build_rasterio.ipynb (both in notebook and script) (raster2mosaic.py is old) 

4- plot the final mosaic.tif in QGIS


also:

1- add_datetime_to_training_dataset.ipynb

2- extract_transect_and_plot_from_ATM_locations.ipynb

3- transect_statistics.ipynb
